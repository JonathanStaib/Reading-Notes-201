# Reading notes for Class 04

## Class 4 Reading Notes

### Learn HTML

- 1. The element we use is an <a> link with a href attribute
- 2. The href attribute would contain the link
- 3. To make links easily accessible by readers... Use clear link wording, You can also use the CSS element fixed so that the nav bar would always be at the top of there screen. This relates to clear link wording but be short but descriptive make sure they know where they are going.

### CSS Layout

- 1. Normal Flow is the way the blocks and elements flow are displayed naturally before any changes are made to the layout.
- 2. The difference between a block level element and an inline element are that A block level element fills the available inline space while an inline element is just the size of the content.
- 3. Static positioning is the default for every html element.
- 4. A few advantages to using absolute positioning is that you can utalize popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that you can move around the page and can drop anywhere. Also, my favorite, you can create hidden text. I believe you can also do this with a hover feature?
- 5. The difference between fixed positioning and abosolute positioning is that fixed positioning will remain on the screen no matter how far you scroll.

### Learn JS

- 1. The difference beyween a function declaration and invocation is that in a declaration you are defining a variable or declaring it, then you have to invoke or call the function to let it run. They work together but are not the same.
- 2. The difference between arguments and parameters are that arguments are the values passed during the functions call. Parameters are the values defined at the time of the creation of the function.

### Benefits to Pair Programming

- Greater efficiency: this is useful because it is great to have another pair of eyes when working on code. Maybe you will miss something completetly obvious. Also it is nice to have another person to talk to so you aren't sitting at your computer 9 hours a day going insane.
- Social Skills: It is definetly a way to improve your social skills as well as getting better speaking about your code. It is one thing to be able to write code but voicing and describing what is going on is a much different story. Again it also nice to talk to someone every now and then for mental health purposes.

## Class 4 Lecture Notes

### CSS positioning

- static- is everything, position static
- relative- left right px moves a section in a specific direction
- absolute- absolute doesnt take up space
- Fixed- fits to the whole screen and its fixed onto that spot on your screen

### Functions

- A Data Type!

#### WHat is it?

- Reusable piece of code
- A group of statements that perform a task or calculate a value stored in a structure that prevents them from running until teh function is 'called' or 'invoked'
  - Input -> processing -> output

#### Why do we use functions?

- reusable
- easier to read
- efficient
- keeps our code dry - DONT REPEAT YOURSELF
- prevents bugs
- perform actions !

#### 2 Step process

- want to define or declare the function
- then you call and invoke the function
