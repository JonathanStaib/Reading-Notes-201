### Learn CSS - FlexBox

1. One-Dimensional Content is a bunch of items that have different sizes and other properties and making the best layout for that group of items. It makes it so that instead of setting rigid dimensions for the web it will instead provide felx boundaries to show how the content would display.
2. The difference between the main axis and the cross axis is that the main axis runs along the row horizontally and the corss axis runs along the column veritcally.
3. There are some things such as row-reverse and column-reverse that the reordering will only change visually but not logically. This could negatively impact accssibilty.

### CSS Layout - FlexBox

1. Some advantages to using Flexbox over float are that its more convenient and flexible. You can veritcally center a block of content inside its parent. You can make all children of a container take up equal space regardless of width or height. It can make all colums the same height no matter their content.
2. FlexBox can save us a lot of time rather than sitting their for hours trying to calculate exact measurements for our web pages. It will make styling much more effecient and reliable. This is how I can see it effecting our long term goals. It will save us a lot of time and help our pages look cleaner and both of those = money.
